# Blue Garden

## Project Description
__Blue Garden__ is a way to automate the watering of a garden via sensors and a single base station that communicates with the sensors wirelessly. The wireless communication protocol used is __Bluetooth Low Energy__, because minimizing sensor radio use for power conservation was one of the project goals.
